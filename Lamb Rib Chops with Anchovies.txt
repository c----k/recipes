Lamb Rib Chops with Anchovies

Ingredients Needed:

¼ cup of olive or salad oil
¾ teaspoon salt
¾ teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon oregano
1 clove garlic, chopped
4 rib lamb chops, about 1 inch thick
4 anchovies, chopped
2 teaspoons of lemon juice
2 teaspoons of dry mustard

Combine oil, ½ teaspoon of salt, ½ teaspoon pepper, ½ teaspoon oregano, and ½ clove of garlic in a container.  Add chops and chill for 1 hour.

Turn chops occasionally.

In a separate bowl, combine the remaining ¼ teaspoon of salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper, ½ teaspoon oregano, ½ clove of garlic with the anchovies, lemon juice, and mustard.

Spread about ½ of the mixture above on chops and broil the chops about 3 to 4 inches from the source of heat for 5 to 7 minutes.  Turn the chops and spread the remaining anchovy mixture on the other side.  Broil that side for another 5 to 7 minutes or to the desired degree of doneness.
